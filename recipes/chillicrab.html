    <p>You can't visit Singapore without rolling up your sleeves and diving into a plate of 
       iconic chili crab, Singapore's unofficial national dish. Crabs are served in a huge 
       puddle of tomato sauce that's sweet, spicy, tangy, and often thickened with egg. 
       Though the shells have been pre-smashed, you've got to dig in and use whatever tool 
       you can find, like chopsticks or fingers (tiny forks are not handed out here) to suck 
       out every morsel of succulent, sweet crab. Bibs? I've never seen one. This is not a first 
       date kind of a dish. </p>

    <p>Chili crab was created in Singapore in the 1950s by Cher Yam Tian. After experimenting in 
        her kitchen for family and friends, her crabs became a hit, and her family opened their 
        first restaurant, Palm Beach Seafood. Since then, the dish has become a staple on menus 
        across Singapore, from hawker centers to fancy restaurants.</p>
