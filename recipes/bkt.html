    <p>Bak kut teh (also spelt bah kut teh; Chinese: 肉骨茶 Bah-kut-tê, is a pork rib dish cooked in broth infused with herbs such as dong quai, cinnamon, star anise, and made with pork ribs, dried shiitake mushrooms, tofu puffs and garlic[6] popularly served in Malaysia and Singapore where there is a predominant Hoklo and Teochew community.</p>

    <p>The name literally translates from the Hokkien dialect as "meat bone tea", and at its simplest, consists of meaty pork ribs simmered in a complex broth of herbs and spices (including star anise, cinnamon, cloves, dong quai, fennel seeds and garlic) for hours. Despite its name, there is in fact no tea in the dish itself; the name refers to a strong oolong Chinese tea which is usually served alongside the soup in the belief that it dilutes or dissolves the copious amount of fat consumed in this pork-laden dish.</p>
